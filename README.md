## list of books, classes and other sources I used to learn c++ so far(as of October 2024):

- community college class - gave basic understanding of the language. didn't go too deep with it.
- learncpp.com - good one. thorough with good explanations.


books used:
- C++ Data Structures and Algorithms Packt publishing
- Compilers. Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman
- Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 3rd Edition B. Stroustrup
- C++ Primer (5th Edition) 5th Edition by Stanley Lippman
- a bit of ChatGPT to explain concepts and other books and Internet for doublechecking facts
