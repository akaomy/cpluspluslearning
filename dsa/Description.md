# General

My overall goal with this DSA project is to learn it
using real-life scenarios as I can relate to them more.
AS well as using backward to widespread approach of learning something:
problem-driven discovery - finding problems first then deriving patterns 
to solve them. 
I find that I learn best this way even though it can potentially take 
more time to learn the concept, although in this case, there is usually 
no focus on a single expected concept.

I want to attempt several different approaches:
- building "broken" systems — write inefficient brute force code to improve it
- "why it works" — solving game puzzles and deriving patterns from the solutions
- use real-life scenarios — mimicking existing systems from scratch working backwards
to understand the DS needed to make it work
- gamified learning by playing resource-management games and thinking about data structure
that is used in it
- solve multiple unrelated problems and look for patterns in the approach of solving them
