# Description:
System that allows to automatically generate nedded input
to test particular problem, outputs modified data into
separate file, and verifies expected versus actual resulted data


## input
.txt file with input data

## data processing
location of those miniprogramms in cpluspluslearning/exercises folder

## output
.txt file with output data

## tests
don't know yet about tools used for this for c++


### steps:
1. script that generates data and outputs it into a input_data_for___[name of the program that modifies or sorts data].txt file
    1.2 script that reads data from .txt file
2. script that outputs data into output_data_for_[name of the program that modifies or sorts data].txt
3. scipt that reads output_data...txt file and checks it agains expected result (how will it look like?)
