# General concepts

## 4 main concepts of OOP:
1) Encapsulation
is about using classes that have member variables and member functions.
During runtime object is created and its member variables are getting
operated by the function members. The functions define the behavior of an object
during runtime.

2) Abstraction
for reducing complexity that allows to focus only on most important parts at a moment e.g. 
hiding implementation of a class in a header file and use its functions in .cpp file.

3) Inheritance
for extending functionality of parent classes

4) Polymorphism
how the object behaves based on which subclass instantiated it.

## Principles of OOP:
- Single Responsibility Principle - class should have only one primary responsibility
- Encapsulate What Varies Principle - code that varies should be isolated from other code otherwise it can 
cause other code to change
- Delegate Principle - once class can perform work of another class
- Principle of the Least Knowledge - classes should not know about each other's implementation, and they
should either loosely couple with a few classes or not coupled at all.
- Open - Closed Principle - class should be closed for modification but open for extention
- Code to Interface Principle - TODO
- Do not Repeat Yourself - TODO
